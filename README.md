Welcome to the Stock Market Prediction project! This repository contains a data science project aimed at predicting stock prices using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to build a robust predictive model that can forecast stock prices based on historical data. By analyzing patterns and trends from past stock market data, we aim to make informed predictions for future price movements. This project is intended for educational and research purposes and does not provide financial advice.

## Data

The project utilizes historical  daily prices of Microsoft Stock (MSFT). The dataset includes essential features such as opening price, closing price, high, low, and trading volume. We preprocess the data and engineer relevant features to prepare it for training and testing the predictive model.

## Methodology

We employ a time series forecasting approach, utilizing machine learning algorithms like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) This model is well-suited for handling sequential data and capturing temporal dependencies in stock price movements.
